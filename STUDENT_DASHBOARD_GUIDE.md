## 🔄 Current Functionality

### What Works Now:

1. ✅ Student login redirects to dashboard
2. ✅ Dashboard displays all enrolled courses
3. ✅ Shows course thumbnails, titles, and instructor info
4. ✅ Displays progress bars (random percentage for now)
5. ✅ Shows enrolled and completed course counts
6. ✅ "Watch Course" button reloads the same page (as requested)
7. ✅ Navigation tabs structure in place
8. ✅ Empty state when no courses enrolled

### What's Placeholder:

-   Other tab contents (Dashboard, Active Courses, Completed Courses, etc.)
-   Actual progress calculation (currently random 10-95%)
-   Completed course count (currently 0)
-   Watch course functionality (currently just reloads page)

## 📝 Database Requirements

Make sure you have:

-   `students` table with columns: id, name, email, image, etc.
-   `courses` table with columns: id, title, description, image, instructor_id, etc.
-   `instructors` table with columns: id, name, image, etc.
-   `enrollments` table with columns: id, student_id, course_id, created_at, updated_at

## 🚀 How to Test

1. **Login as a student**:

    - Navigate to `/student/login`
    - Enter student credentials
    - You'll be redirected to `/student/dashboard`

2. **View enrolled courses**:

    - The "All Courses" tab is active by default
    - You'll see all courses the student has enrolled in
    - Each course card shows progress and details

3. **Empty state**:
    - If student has no enrollments, you'll see a message to enroll in courses

## 📋 Routes

```php
// Student Dashboard
Route::get('student/dashboard', [LoginController::class, 'dashboard'])
    ->name('student.dashboard')
    ->middleware('auth:student');
```

## 💡 Tips

-   Course images are stored in `public/uploads/courses/`
-   Instructor images are stored in `public/uploads/instructors/`
-   Student images are stored in `public/uploads/students/`
-   If no image exists, UI Avatars API is used as fallback

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

**Issue**: No courses showing

-   Check if student has enrollments in database
-   Verify relationships are working: `$student->courses()->get()`

**Issue**: Images not loading

-   Check if image paths exist in public/uploads folder
-   Verify image filenames match database records

**Issue**: Progress not showing

-   Currently using random percentage (10-95%)
-   Implement actual progress tracking for real percentages
